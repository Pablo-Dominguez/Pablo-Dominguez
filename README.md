- ðŸ”­ I'm currently leading the development of a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system at Telefonica. Think of it as a customized, in-house version of what OpenAI is doing. The goal is to make day-to-day operations easier for different teams in the company. As the lead developer, I get to design and implement features for the interface that'll deliver these AI solutions. The aim is to make the company's information, data sources, and processes more efficient and connected. I'm using a tech stack involving Airflow, Python, Docker, Linux, and Azure to make it happen.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently working on two personal projects in my free time. One is a mixed integer linear problem related to my previous PhD research. It's all about machine learning and mathematical optimization, which I'm specially passionate about. The other project is centered around GÃ¶del and Hilbert's theories, focusing on the intriguing self-reference problem. I've been trying to wrap my head around these complex concepts and apply them in interesting ways. It's like solving a puzzle, and I love the challenge!
- âš¡ Fun fact about me: I can solve the Rubik's cube in less than twelve seconds!
